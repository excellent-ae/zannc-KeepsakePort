## Currently Added:
    -- Thanatos Keepsake
    -- Persephone Keepsake
    -- Hermes Keepsake
    -- Eurydice Keepsake
    -- Patroclus Keepsake
    -- Sisyphus Keepsake

    -- Configuration options for all keepsakes!

## Gifting Options
    -- To max out Thanatos, you need to level the Moonstone Axe to level 5
    -- Hermes functions the same as the game default.
    -- Persephone functions the same as the game default - gift to Hades With Persephone

    -- Eurydice, Patroclus and Sisyphus gifting will be introduced with the Hades_Biomes mod.

### Planned
Nyx, Chaos (old) and Megaera. \
Codex for all keepsakes (maybe) \
Thanatos & Hermes fail sounds, fix camera also. \
Fix Hermes in Fields - it starts on first unlock, but doesnt clear when mini-encounter ends - a non issue since you can clear entire room
